# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This book serves as a compilation of  of handouts, websites and tutorials that I have used in my data reporting class at ASU's [Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication](cronkite.asu.edu). Some of the material will be useful in other courses or for self-study, but it is primarily aimed at the investigative journalism masters' students at Cronkite.

It covers: 

- Reporting and replication in data journalism
- Table stakes: Spreadsheets in the newsroom
- Analyzing data for stories using R and R Markdown


It doesn't cover: 

- Data visualization for publication
- Working with non-tabular data such as images, sound or document collections
- Creating news applications
- Freedom of Information and public records techniques
- Data science. This is a journalism book, not a programming or statistics book. 

A note on language: I'll use the words "read" and "write" in a generic sense. I intend them to cover the range of journalistic media, including listening, watching, and news applications or graphics.
